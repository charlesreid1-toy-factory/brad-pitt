This repository is a demonstration of a super simple Python
package that implements some useful features for versioned
packages:

* [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
  for markdown-based documentation
* [mkautodoc](https://github.com/tomchristie/mkautodoc)
  to automatically generate documentation of a Python API
* [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version/)
  for bumping versions in an automated way
* [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike)
  to manage mkdocs documentation for multiple versions
